Get Started!
------------

Ready to contribute? Here's how to set up ``pydash`` for local development.

1. Fork the ``pydash`` repo on GitHub.
2. Clone your fork locally::

    $ git clone git@github.com:your_name_here/pydash.git

3. Install your local copy into a virtualenv. Assuming you have virtualenv installed, this is how you set up your fork for local development::

    $ cd pydash
    $ pip install -r requirements-dev.txt

4. Create a branch for local development::

    $ git checkout -b name-of-your-bugfix-or-feature

   Now you can make your changes locally.

5. When you're done making changes, check that your changes pass linting and all unit tests by testing with tox across all supported Python versions::

    $ invoke tox

6. Add yourself to ``AUTHORS.rst``.

7. Commit your changes and push your branch to GitHub::

    $ git add .
    $ git commit -m "Detailed description of your changes."
    $ git push origin name-of-your-bugfix-or-feature

8. Submit a pull request through the GitHub website.


Pull Request Guidelines
-----------------------

Before you submit a pull request, check that it meets these guidelines:

1. The pull request should include tests.
2. If the pull request adds functionality, the docs should be updated. Put your new functionality into a function with a docstring, and add the feature to the README.rst.
3. The pull request should work for Python 2.7, 3.4, 3.5, and 3.6. Check https://travis-ci.org/dgilland/pydash/pull_requests and make sure that the tests pass for all supported Python versions.
