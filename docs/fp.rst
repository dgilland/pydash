FP Variations

Pydash exposes a variant set of its functions which are auto-curried,
iteratee-first, data-last, and non-mutating.
These functions are available in ``pydash.fp``.
The creation of this module is inspired by, and reflects much of the
functionality in ``lodash/fp``, however it differs in a few significant
ways as well.

Currying
=========

The fp variant functions are curried, meaning that one can provide
arguments in multiple function calls, like so:

.. code-block:: python

    # the following two calls are equivalent
    fp.union_by(lambda x: x % 2, [1, 2, 3], [2, 3, 4])

    fp.union_by(lambda x: x % 2)([1, 2, 3])([2, 3, 4])


This means that each function must receive a fixed minimum 
number of arguments.  Keyword arguments are not supported.
As much as possible, support is provided for multiple data
arguments where the original function allows it:


.. code-block:: python

    fp.intersection_by(round)([1.2, 1.5, 1.7, 2.8], [0.9, 3.2], [1.1])

In some cases, a default parameter value can be specified by passing
``None``:

.. code-block:: python

    fp.intersection_by(None, [1, 2, 3], [2, 3, 4])

Rearranged Arguments
=====================

Function arguments are rearranged to facilitate composition.
In most cases, iteratee is given first and data last.


Placeholder
===========

It is possible to provide arguments in a different order by use of the
placeholder.  A placeholder is filled by the first available argument:

.. code-block:: python

    from pydash.fp import _

    # the following two calls are equivalent
    fp.intersperse(0)([1, 2, 3])

    fp.intersperse(_, [1, 2, 3])(0)


No Mutation
=============

Some pydash functions mutate the target object.
The fp variants of these functions are *non-mutating*.


Iteratee Capping
=================

In contradistinction to ``lodash/fp``, iteratees in ``pydash.fp`` are *not*
capped.


Documentation
==============

The documentation for fp variant functions is automatically generated
from the pydash docstrings.  All effort is made to ensure that the
conversion is complete and correct.  Please report any errors.

astor_ is used in converting the code examples.  This package is not a hard
requirement for using the library, but if it is not available, the examples
will be left out of the documentation.
